This repo contains some sub projects that help understand advanced techniques used in PyTorch system. This repo contains following subprojects:
* Build first python package
* A simple pytorch demo project, from byrzhm, shows how to use pybind11 to use c++ as backend.
* A workshop to show features introduced in PyTorch2.0
* A small tutorial for pytest
* A naive Kernal Library in Triton, ref to FlagGems
